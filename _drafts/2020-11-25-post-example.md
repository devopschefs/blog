Nested and mixed lists are an interesting beast. It's a corner case to make sure that

* Lists within lists do not break the ordered list numbering order
* Your list styles go deep enough.

### Ordered -- Unordered -- Ordered

1. ordered item
2. ordered item
   * **unordered**
   * **unordered**
     1. ordered item
     2. ordered item
3. ordered item
4. ordered item

### Unordered -- Unordered -- Ordered

* unordered item
* unordered item
  * unordered
  * unordered
    1. **ordered item**
    2. **ordered item**
* unordered item
* unordered item

### Task Lists
