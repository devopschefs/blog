This week I was looking for sites to study Microsoft Azure, and a friend sent me a very helpfull link, so I'm using it to broaden my knowledge about this awesome tool. On my search I found lots of sites, but I'm sharing only official ones that I found really helpfull. Enjoy!

## [Azure Training Courses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/)

In this site you are going to find various classes about Cloud Management and Development, Data Analytics and DevOps. The focus are technologies such as [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (Platform as a Service), [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) (Infrastructure as a Service) and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (Software as a Service).

## [Azure Hands On Labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=sitertzn_homepage_learn-redirect-handsonlabs)

Here you will find various classes about Microsoft products, including Azure and Azure DevOps. The hands on labs (HOLs) are very usefull whenever you don't want the hassle of not needing to setup an account just to test something. So enjoy the HOLs!
