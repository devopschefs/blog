Continuing our tips about where to find good sources to study Microsoft Azure, which started [here]({{ site.url }}/cloud/azure-study-guide-part1). Yesterday I was looking at some certifications and I found some usefull stuff.

## Microsoft Learning

## Community

Youtube channel with lots of videos about various Azure services.

- [Azure for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/c/Azure4Everyone)

This guy posted lots of links to other websites to study for the AZ-400 exam.

- [Exam AZ-400 Stanislas.io](https://stanislas.io/2019/07/26/preparation-guide-for-microsoft-az-400-microsoft-azure-devops-solutions-certification/)

In this website you will find not only training courses for Azure, but a lot of other tools. This one you can't miss.
